# Python Descriptive Statistics Project (Pandas)

![Python CI](https://github.com/nogibjj/ids706-mini-project-2/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This project is focused on calculating descriptive statistics utilizing a Python setup with CI/CD implemented through GitHub Actions. It comes with a **.devcontainer** setup for streamlined development within a Docker container using Visual Studio Code.
 
## üöÄ Getting Started

### Local Development with VS Code and .devcontainer
1. Ensure **Docker** is installed and running on your machine.
2. Install the **Remote - Containers** extension in VS Code.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine.
4. Open the repository in VS Code.
5. A notification will appear suggesting you reopen the project in a container. Click "Reopen in Container". (Alternatively, press **F1**, type "Remote-Containers: Reopen Folder in Container", and press Enter.)
6. Initially, Docker will build an image based on the defined **Dockerfile**. This step might take a few minutes.
7. Once inside the container, a Python environment, isolated from your local system, is prepared for your use.

### üß™ Running Tests

To initiate tests in this project, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```
 
This command runs all the unit tests and ensures that any changes made haven't introduced new issues.
